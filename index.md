## üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Experience

**Machine Learning Projects** - [See Them Here!](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects)
My github DS Project page hosts a variety of Machine Learning & Data Science projects that I am proud of.
I recommend looking at the following projects, they are my favorite!
  - [Deep Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects/tree/main/Multi%20Layer%20Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch)
  - [CNN Mnist Ensemble (Kaggle Top 2%)](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects/tree/main/CNN%20Mnist%20Ensemble)
  - [Human Emotion Detection](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects/tree/main/Emotion%20Detection)
  - [KFold for Neural Nets](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects/blob/main/KFold%20Cross%20Val%20for%20NN/kfold-example-project-company-bankcruptcy.ipynb)

And the one I use most often :
  - [Auto Open Jupyter Notebook (or Lab)](https://github.com/lilromeoz00/DS-Projects/tree/main/Auto%20Open%20Jupyter%20Lab)

**Languages & Libraries**
Some of the langauges and libraries I either use in my personal projects or have knowledge in
  - Python & SQL
  - Tensoflow + Keras
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Sklearn, etc (The typical Data Science libraries)
